# Installing WordPress with WooCommerce on a LAMP Cluster in Microsoft Azure
This document explains how to install WordPress with the WooCommerce plugin on a LAMP cluster in Azure. 
The following diagram shows how the required system components participate in the installation process.

## Prerequisites

To install WordPress with the WooCommerce plugin, you must prepare your system environment as follows:
- Deploy a LAMP stack to create the Controller VM that will host the WordPress with WooCommerce installation. To support the current installation, the LAMP stack must be running:
	*	Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
	*	Nginx web server 1.10.3
	*	MySQL PaaS 5.6, 5.7 or 8.0 database server
	*	PHP 7.2, 7.3, or 7.4 
	
- Make sure the Ansible VM is located in the same Azure resource group and region that hosts the Controller VM.

## Overview of the Installation Process
The installation process consists of the following high-level procedures:
* Enable password authentication on the Controller VM
* Deploy the Ansible VM to install WordPress with WooCommerce on the Controller VM


### Enable Password Authentication on the Controller VM
Enabling password authentication allows you to obtain the Controller VM credentials and copy the SSH keys that you will need to deploy the Ansible VM later in the installation process.

1. Log in to the Controller VM and navigate to the /home/*azureadmin(user)*/ directory, where *azureadmin(user)* represents the username of the Azure admin account.
2. Run the following commands to enable password authentication.

```
sudo sed -i "s~PasswordAuthentication no~PasswordAuthentication yes~" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
sudo sed -i "s~#UseLogin no~UseLogin yes~" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
sudo sed -i "s~#   StrictHostKeyChecking ask~   StrictHostKeyChecking no~" /etc/ssh/ssh_config
sudo systemctl restart sshd
sudo passwd azureadmin
```
3. When prompted, configure a new password for the Controller VM.
4. Gather the following information from the Controller VM:
	* Controller VM username
	* Controller VM IP address
	* Controller VM password (the new password that you configured in the previous step)

### Deploy the Ansible VM to Install WordPress with WooCommerce

The Ansible VM will be used to execute the WordPress installation script. To deploy the Ansible VM, you use the ARM Template and provide input parameters describing the Controller VM and the new database that will be created during the installation of WordPress.

1. Use the [ARM Template](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fummadisudhakar%2FLAMP%2Fansible_playbook_mat32%2Fansibledeploy-wordpress.json) to start the Ansible VM deployment. Make sure you are deploying the Ansible VM into the same Azure resource group and region that hosts the Controller VM.
2. Enter the name of the Ansible VM.
3. Enter the Controller VM information that you gathered earlier:
	* SSH public key
	* Controller VM username
	* Controller VM IP address
	* Controller VM password
4. Enter the information for the new WordPress database:
	*	Server name of the MySQL server in the LAMP cluster
	*	Login username for the MySQL server
	*	Login password for the MySQL server
	*	Name of the new WordPress database
5. Enter additional configuration information:
	*	Domain name of the WordPress instance
	*	Domain name of the load balancer, which you can obtain from the Azure Portal

The following processes occur during the deployment:
- The ARM Template executes the wordpress_main.sh script from the extensionâ€™s. 
- The wordpress_main.sh script downloads the Ansible script (wordpress_script.sh) from GitHub.
- The downloaded wordpress_script.sh script is placed in the /home/*azureadmin(user)* directory on the Ansible VM, where *azureadmin(user)* represents the username of the Azure admin account.
	
Once the deployment is complete, the Ansible VM extension executes the wordpress_script.sh script, which installs WordPress and the WooCommerce plugin using an Ansible playbook.

The run.sh file runs the Ansible script wordpress_script.sh consisting of the Ansible playbook with the following roles:

- **Role: SSH Key Configuration**  
Generates the SSH key pair and copies the key pair to the Controller VM using password authentication.
	
- **Role: WordPress**  
Downloads and installs WordPress on the Controller VM.
	
- **Role: WooCommerce**  
Downloads and installs the WooCommerce plugin on the Controller VM.
	
- **Role: Replication**  
This role executes the following functions:
  * __Configure SSL Certs:__ Generates the required OpenSSL certificates and places them in the /azlamp/certs/ directory.
  * __Linking Data Location:__ Links the data directory (/azlamp/data/) to all shared web frontend instances.
  * __Create Nginx Configuration:__ Creates the Nginx configuration file in the Virtual Machine Scale Set (VMSS) instance.
  * __Replication:__ Replicates the WordPress directory to the VMSS instance for high availability.

When all the roles are executed, the installation is complete.

## Accessing WordPress
- To open WordPress, connect to the Azure load balancer using its IP address. You can obtain the load balancer's IP address from the Azure Portal.

- To log in to WordPress, use the username and password provided in the wordpress.txt file at /home/*azureadmin(user)*, where *azureadmin(user)* represents the username of the Azure admin account.
